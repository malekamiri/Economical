# Economical

## Inspiration

Helping the homeless, reducing wasted food, providing cheap and nutritious options for food are all our inspiration for this project.

## What it does

Economical provides a catalog of food showing the cheapest foods first. People can look at the catalog and find the cheapest food items.

## How we built it

We used android studio and implemented the NCR API through postman and HTTP requests using OKHTTP.

## Challenges we ran into

Formatting the JSON data and consolidating the relevant keys were a challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to connect to the NCR API by using Postman. We used the Java OKHTTP library and we were able to display the JSON data.

## What we learned

We got more familiar with Android Studio, learned about API's and how to pull and parse HTTP requests. We learned more about JSON objects and arrays.

##  What's next for Economical

We plan on improving the overall design.
